## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Mobile-first workflow



### What I learned

While working through this project i recap of how to center the div-container without using flexbox or grid. 

```css
.container {
  background: hsl(0, 0%, 100%);
  padding: 15px;
  width: 285px;
  height: 460px;
  border-radius: 10px;
  position: absolute;
  top: 50%;
  left: 50%;
  transform: translate(-50%, -50%);
}
```


### Continued development

Under construction....

### Useful resources

- [Box-sizing](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/box-sizing) - This helped me for adjusting the total woidth and height of an element. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
